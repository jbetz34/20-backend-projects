# 20-backend-projects

This repo will track my progress in a challenge I set for myself to build every project specified in https://roadmap.sh/backend/project-ideas. Its a personal challenge and I don't expect much traffic to the repo, so the READMEs will be slim. There may be cases where I build a project twice,  I expect this to happen when I am learning a new concept or library. I will try to do the project both with and without the library to firm up my understanding of the concepts. For example project0 was first inspired by a blog written in ruby: https://blog.postman.com/how-to-build-an-api/. I want to use python for the majority of these projects, so I also implemented it in python. For more details on the project, I will try to copy/paste the site description of the project on the individual project READMEs. I will try to be vigilent about explaining how to use the project in the README, but I don't want to burdern myself too much since I don't think this project will meet anyone's gaze except my own.
